## Comments

I was slightly confused by the third task ('Display the completed number of todo items'). I was unsure whether it was the number value (i.e. 90) that was wanted or the total 90 titles displayed on the page. I did both and then added the option to see the incomplete tasks too, since the functionality was already there.
